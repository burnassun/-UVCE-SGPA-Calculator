# UVCE SGPA Calculator

A user-friendly SGPA calculator for UVCE students, developed using Python and Tkinter. The application allows students to input their internal and approximate semester marks for subjects in either the **P Cycle** or **C Cycle** and calculates the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) based on weighted points.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a simple and effective way for students of the University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering (UVCE) to calculate their SGPA for a given semester. The application takes internal and approximate semester marks, computes the SGPA, and alerts the user if they have failed any subject.

## Features

- **Cycle Selection:** Choose between P Cycle and C Cycle.
- **Input Marks:** Enter internal and approximate semester marks for each subject.
- **SGPA Calculation:** Calculate SGPA based on weighted points for each subject.
- **Fail Detection:** Identify subjects where the user has failed.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design using Tkinter.

## Installation

To run the SGPA Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/uvce-sgpa-calculator.git
   cd uvce-sgpa-calculator
   ```

2. **Install Tkinter:**

   Tkinter is a standard Python library, but you may need to install it depending on your system:

   - **For Windows:**

     Tkinter is usually included with Python. If not, you can download the latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) and make sure to check "Tcl/Tk and IDLE" during installation.

   - **For macOS:**

     Tkinter is included with the Python distribution on macOS. If you encounter issues, you might need to reinstall Python or install XQuartz.

   - **For Linux:**

     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install python3-tk
     ```

3. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   python sgpa_calculator.py
   ```

## Usage

Here's a quick guide on how to use the UVCE SGPA Calculator:

1. **Select Cycle:** Choose either **P Cycle** or **C Cycle** by selecting the appropriate radio button.

2. **Enter Marks:** For each subject, input the internal marks (out of 50) and the approximate semester marks (out of 100).

3. **Calculate SGPA:** Click the **Calculate SGPA** button. The application will compute and display your SGPA, along with a list of subjects you have failed, if any.

4. **Error Handling:** If you input invalid marks, such as internal marks greater than 50 or semester marks greater than 100, an error message will alert you to correct your input.

### Example:

1. Select **P Cycle**.
2. Enter the following marks:
   - Media: Internal: 45, Sem: 80
   - Maths: Internal: 40, Sem: 95
   - Electrical: Internal: 48, Sem: 85
   - Physics: Internal: 42, Sem: 75
   - Physics Lab: Internal: 38, Sem: 90
   - Electrical Lab: Internal: 39, Sem: 88
   - Graphics: Internal: 50, Sem: 92
   - Mechanics: Internal: 35, Sem: 78
   - English: Internal: 47, Sem: 85
3. Click **Calculate SGPA**.
4. Result: "Your SGPA is 8.75".

## Grading System

The application calculates points based on the following grading system:

| Total Marks (Internal + (Semester / 2)) | Points |
|-----------------------------------------|--------|
| 90 - 100                                | 10     |
| 80 - 89                                 | 9      |
| 70 - 79                                 | 8      |
| 60 - 69                                 | 7      |
| 50 - 59                                 | 6      |
| 40 - 49                                 | 5      |
| Below 40                                | Fail   |
